Dust Logger images from boreholes 21, 50, 66, 52, 10, 2, 86 and 14 were taken between 2004 and 2011 (Fig. 1).  Using these data, we can reconstruct provisional dust profiles for every string in the array.  Accounting for the distortions and fine structure in dust could <A HREF="http://icecube.wisc.edu/~dima/work/WISC/ppc/fit/tilt/model/">improve the detector model</A>.

<p>By aligning dust features in depth we combine all optical logs to form an "average" dust profile, then map this composite profile to any location in the array.  Features are mapped automatically using Dynamic Time Warping (described in detail <a href="../2009JD013741.pdf">here</a>) at full ~2 mm effective resolution.  In some instances, small mapping errors may wash out fine scale features (&#60&#60;1 m) in forming the composite.</p>

<p>The optical profiles are highly repeatable and correspond closely with dust measurements in Antarctic ice cores. The composite South Pole optical profile (Fig. 2) is by far the best resolved and most stratigraphically coherent record of Antarctic dust during the last glacial period.

<p>To determine the dust profile for a hole which has not been logged, we interpolate or extrapolate using the eight dust logs as reference points.  Holes within the convex hull defined by the logs can be interpolated with a standard natural neighbor method (Delaunay tessellation), while holes outside must be extrapolated, here we use a modified ridge estimator.  <i>Extrapolated dust profiles</font></i> for strings not enclosed by dust logs, e.g. 75-78, <i>should be treated with caution.</i>  Note that Hole 21 was only logged to 2113 m, so the bottom ~350 meters in the southeast corner is to some extent an extrapolation.</p>

Detector variables are useful as guidance in evaluating the dust map, particularly for locations far from dust log reference points.  This plot shows stacked track miss probability for strings with few if any bad DOMs (provided by Dawn Williams) and which are close to dust logged holes, overlaid with average dust and all warped to a common depth of String 86 at the array center.  Fine details in dust structure become more important in cleaner ice.  Features which appear as spikes in the dust logs can strongly affect the detector response but are currently not accounted for in simulations.  Although thin, these layers are pronounced local maxima in scattering and absorption compared to the bulk, and tend to dump photons.

<p>
We continue to refine the South Pole age scale, now nearly 90% of the way to bedrock.  At shallow and intermediate depths in bubbly ice, we used ash layers from Dust Logger images that we could unambiguously associate with layers we detected in dust logs at Siple Dome and Dome C.  In the deep clear ice we tied our logs to dust measurements in the Dome C and EDML ice cores.  In Figure 7 we have extrapolated to bedrock using 1) a simple two-parameter quadratic depth transformation (0.389d - 0.56<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">x</font>10<sup>-3</sup>d<sup>2</sup>) of Dome C age, forced through the origin and matched to our deepest dust features, and 2) a polynomial fit to all control points, including one below 2500 m extrapolated from Titan Dome Base, taken to be 165 kyr at 2850 m.  Hole 86 is closest to the center of the array, while the Hole 66 dust log reached the farthest back in time.

The dashed red curve is a polynomial fit through our volcanic tie points, dust tie points, and a bedrock age estimate extrapolated from Titan Dome; the solid blue curve is Dome C age versus depth scaled to match SP tie points; the dotted gray curve was the prediction based on early AMANDA observations and a simple model.  An increase in accumulation rate during the Eemian period is evident in the Dome C analog.

<center><h4><u>Ash Layers</u></h4></center>
From these images and dust logs made at Siple Dome (West Antarctica) and Dome C (East Antarctica), together with ice core measurements, we can identify certain depositions at South Pole to be volcanic.  We currently have around 20 candidate ash layers, with roughly half lying at IceCube instrumented depths.

Fig 8. Volcanic ash layers in the ice at South Pole present optical singularities that can appear light or dark, depending on ash albedo and context. Only the first has been confirmed in a shallow ice core; a few others can be associated with layers at other locations which have been chemically confirmed as volcanic.

<center><h4><u>How the Dust Logger works</u></h4></center>
<p>
The Dust Logger makes high definition images of optical effects due to particulates and bubbles, integrated over an area of order m<small><sup>2</sup></small> of the horizon.  Residual air bubbles reduce the contrast of dust scattering and make unambiguous identification of horizons increasingly difficult shallower than about 1200 m and into the Last Glacial Maximum around ~1150 m.  In all dust profiles the effects of bubble scattering have been removed with an amplitude correction of 0.37% per meter above 1350 m (Fig. 8).  At depths below 1350 m where all bubbles have converted to air hydrates, the logger signal closely tracks insoluble mineral dust (Fig. 2).</p>

<font size="-1">
<p></p>
Fig 8. An ad hoc amplitude correction, to remove the effects of bubble scattering above 1350 m, has been applied to all Dust Logger profiles.
</font>
</center>

<p>
The logger uses a computer-controlled 404 nm laser line generator, digital photon counter for light detection and a precision Paroscientific pressure sensor for primary depth determination.  Annular black nylon brushes function as baffles to intercept stray photons and sweep detritus, particularly ice crystals, from the light path.  To log Holes 21 and 50 we permanently affixed the probe to the detector string and acquired data while the string was deployed; during the first log in Hole 21, telemetry with the probe was lost below 2113 meters.  In the four subsequent boreholes we used the Robertson logging winch to deploy a ruggedized instrument which we could hoist back to the surface, making profiles on both the down and up trips and recovering the device.  Data are sent as 10-ms samples to the surface using DSL communication.  Logging depth is reconstructed from both pressure readings and winch payout, surveys of the snow surface, well distance to the top of the water column and corrections for water compressibility and cable stretch.  Absolute logger depth accuracy is probably limited to a meter or two, while relative uncertainty over moderate depth intervals is negligible.
